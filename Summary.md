## NYC Taxi Data Analysis Project Summary

### Project Overview

The NYC Taxi Data Analysis project is a comprehensive data engineering and analytics endeavor focused on extracting, transforming, and analyzing taxi trip data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. This project aims to provide valuable insights into taxi trips spanning over a decade, contributing to data-driven decision-making in various sectors.

### Key Steps and Components

1. **Data Extraction and Storage:**
   - Relevant data is extracted from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website, covering a wide timeframe from 2009 to 2023.
   - Extracted data is securely stored, forming the foundation for subsequent analysis and processing.

2. **Data Transformation with PySpark:**
   - Due to computational limitations, a representative subset of the massive dataset is transformed using PySpark.
   - Dimension tables, such as Passenger, Trip, Location, and Rate, are created to structure the data.
   - Fact tables are generated by joining dimension tables, showcasing the potential for powerful analysis.

3. **Orchestration with Mage:**
   - Apache Airflow orchestrates the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure seamless execution.
   - Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) define workflows, maintaining data integrity in the process.

4. **Data Analysis in Google BigQuery:**
   - Processed data is loaded into Google BigQuery, enabling efficient analysis.
   - Though a representative subset is used, the analysis techniques demonstrate their effectiveness on large-scale data.

5. **Dashboard Creation with Looker:**
   - Looker integration with Google BigQuery leads to the creation of interactive dashboards and visualizations.
   - These dashboards allow users to explore data trends and patterns, even with the scaled-down dataset.

### Project Metrics

- Total Rows in Extracted Data: Approximately 1.368 billion rows
- Total Size of Extracted Data: Approximately 143.64 terabytes

### Project Significance

The NYC Taxi Data Analysis project serves as a testament to modern data engineering techniques in handling substantial datasets. Despite transforming a smaller demonstration subset due to computational constraints, the project highlights the potential for valuable insights. The outcomes of the analysis are poised to guide informed decisions in transportation, urban planning, and more.

The project underscores the ability to leverage cutting-edge tools to unlock the value of complex datasets. By navigating through the extraction, transformation, and visualization stages, stakeholders gain insights into a scalable approach for future data analysis initiatives.
